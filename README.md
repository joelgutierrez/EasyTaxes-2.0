# EasyTaxes-2.0
#swift
#iOS mobile application

version 1: just a command line project to calculate your 1040EZ forms

version 2: mobile application to provide the interface for entering data to calculate 1040EZ forms.
Profiles can be created from scratch or built from a personal contact in your contacts application.
Forms can be created for each profile. Then can be stored and referenced for later viewing.
* note data persistence was not added into this project repository.
* if requested: I can give the additional code for you to set this up using Googles Firestore.
* you'll need to add in your google service info.plist file as well
